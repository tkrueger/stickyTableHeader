Sticky Table Headers
==================

This is an adaption of the great work Craig McQueen did when asked for something like this on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1030043/html-table-headers-always-visible-at-top-of-window-when-viewing-a-large-table). See the original code [at his bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/cmcqueen1975/htmlfloatingtableheader/wiki/Home). I adapted it to be used as a coffeescript JQuery UI plugin and changed the way the header sticks to use position: fixed.
